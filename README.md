# <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cGllffv.png" width="75" height="75" /> CatalinaForensicsTool 
A GUI frontend for AppleScript (shell, etc) based forensic artifact retreival. 

Relies on AppleScriptObjC for operation. 

DOES NOT USE SANDBOX. 

Requires various permissions. 

This is not indended to be a standard consumer / production app, as its operation violates many core traits of normal macOS app operation. It is not malicious in any way, just not something the average Jill/Joe should be messing around with in general. 

# To run:
1. Compile it yourself!
2. Download the release .app and run the following command on the file:
xattr -cr CatalinaExporter.app
