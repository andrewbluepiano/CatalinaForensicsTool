A GUI frontend for AppleScript (shell, etc) based forensic artifact retreival. 

DOES NOT USE SANDBOX. 

Relies on AppleScriptObjC for operation. 

FS Event Parsing uses python. 

Requires various permissions. 

If you are not prepared to debug any minor quirks / build failures from things in progress, stick with the releases tab. Those have actually been tested and are bookmarked for functionality. They're not actually "releases". 

This is not indended to be a standard consumer / production app, as its operation violates many core traits of normal macOS app operation. It is not malicious in any way, just not something the average Jill/Joe should be messing around with in general. 

Much more functionality would be availible in a version designed to run with SIP disabled. 

### Known Quirk(s)
* The check password function isnt exactly working as expected. As it should display an alert if you enter it incorrectly in the first box. Hasn't seemed to effect functionality. Will be addressed, but not for a few days at least. 

## Two ways to run:
1. Compile it yourself! (BETTER, SAFER WAY. You should check what a program like this is doing)
2. Download the release .app and run the following command on the file:
xattr -cr CatalinaExporter.app

(Yes, that means the script now shows you how to trigger python stuff. From withing a Cocoa app. Using AppleScript. Pretty mind blowing stuff, huh. ðŸ˜‚)
